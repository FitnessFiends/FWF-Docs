Updates:
- Front end: Have a stateful header widget that works with the progress bars
- Back end: Fixed IDE errors and now is working on routing the JSON packets

Need to discuss:
- We need to figure out how to add a meal or an exercise
	- Do we need to have it just direct to exercise page and meal has a popup
- Two different add buttons(1 for calories, 1 for exercises) vs one

Decisions:
- When you scroll down, it shrinks the macros. It shrinks the rings and shrinks the bars
