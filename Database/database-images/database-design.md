## ER Diagram â€” Fitness App

The ER diagram represents a **fitness tracking application** designed to record user health, diet, and workout activities. It includes entities such as **Users**, **Meal**, **HealthInfo**, **DailyIntake**, **Workout**, and **Exercises**.

Each **User** must have an associated **HealthInfo** record, though some details (like activity level or birthday) may be missing.  
If a **User** logs a **Meal**, it contributes to their **DailyIntake**.  
When **Exercises** are recorded, they must belong to a **Workout**, but a **Workout** can exist without any exercises (for example, as a planned session).
